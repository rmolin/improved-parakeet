These are bots I created in Python for an MMORPG strictly as a learning excercise. Most all of the files use a PyAutoGUI which which is a Python module for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard. The X's and Y's when clicking are specific to the dimensions of my monitor and the player camera.
Many of these are basic, messy, and could be handled in a much more efficient way, however, they successfully did what I intended them to do. 
Some of the scripts that are a little bit more advanced and optimized are: Autominer (3 tick), Cannonball Run (Edgeville), Woodcut Draynor Bank, Blackjacking Hotkeys, and Amulet Running (Al Kharid).
